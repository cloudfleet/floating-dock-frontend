  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    When we created <a href="https://cloudfleet.io/">CloudFleet</a> we noticed
    a gap in the infrastructure we needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Docker Hub does not support builds for different architectures. However most
    containers are architecture agnostic and can be built for any architecture.
  </p>
  <p>
    With ARM servers on the horizon marina.io strives to reproduce the wonderful
    ecosystem of the Docker Hub container by container, to make it easy to
    build your containers for any architecture.
  </p>
  <h2>How?</h2>
  <p>
    Before building the container, we adapt the <code>FROM</code> line to use
    the proper <code>armhf</code> container as a parent.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Where possible we use the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/armhf/">
        <code>armhf</code></a> or <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/aarch64/">
        <code>aarch64</code></a> containers by Docker.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the right one is not available we try to rebuild them from the
        <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/">library
        specs</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If this is also not possible we build an image that is as similar as
        possible. You can suggest more images or improvements to existing ones
        on <a href="https://github.com/marinaio/library/">Github</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      Automated Builds for <code>armhf</code> and <code>aarch64</code>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        For now marina.io builds containers for the architectures
        <code>armhf</code> and <code>aarch64</code>. These are the architectures
        the Raspberry Pi operating systems are running on.
        <br>
        The images are build on our little Raspberry Pi farm.
